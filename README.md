# Embed Discord Bot

A discord.py bot for custom embed messages. It uses *discord.app_commands* (slash commands).  
It saves messages in a SQLite3 database.

**Please make sure to change the *config.py constants* in order to store the TOKEN (*str*) and GUILD (*int*) constants which store their respective IDs (different to everyone) and STATUS (*discord.Status*) & ACTIVITY (*discord.Activity*) constants.**
